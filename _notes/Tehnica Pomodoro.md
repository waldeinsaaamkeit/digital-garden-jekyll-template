title: Tehnica Pomodoro
---
Este un sistem de time management care îți propune să împarți activitățile în „felii” de lucru de 25 minute urmate de 5 minute pauză:
- Alege un task pe care vrei să-l rezolvi.
- Setează un timer să sune după 25 minute. 
- Timp de 25 minute, lucrează la task-ul tău, fără să faci nimic altceva. 
- Când sună alarma, ia o pauză de 5 minute în care te relaxezi.
- După 4 secvențe de 25 + 5, ia o pauză mai mare de 20-30 minute. 

# Problema cu Pomodoro
- Pomodoro is excellent for tackling tasks you don't feel like doing or jobs that require little thought. However, other tasks, like writing or coding, require uninterrupted time. **The problem with the Pomodoro method is that the timer is a consistent interruption that prevents you from getting into a state of flow.**
- I notice that I have used the Pomodoro Technique more for trivial tasks, including sending out e-mails and writing pointless reports, which I don’t necessarily have passion for. Again, I don’t want to say not to use it, but it doesn’t work for me
-   Pomodoro is a great approach to tackling tasks that you don't want to do (like studying for an exam) or tasks that require little thought (like copying and pasting data from a document into a spreadsheet). The short duration of pomodoros and promise of a break as a reward can encourage you to stay focused and do what you need to do.But other tasks like writing, coding, or creating art—tasks that require creativity, innovation, and/or problem-solving—may not be ideal to break into pomodoros. Limiting how much time you dedicate to those tasks may prevent you from getting into flow state and enjoying the benefits of its resulting boost to your productivity and focus.
