This is it. This is my latest invention.

My latest grand discovery.

Life-changing, and yet so simple.

I'm about to tell you why a pack 
of index cards and a binder clip  

is at least five times more usable than 
your traditional poster-sized vision board.

First of all, it's cheap and very discreet.  

If you're lugging around a giant poster 
board with all of your hopes and dreams

on it, there's a big chance that 
somebody is going to see it,

and you might not actually want that to happen.

Instead of plastering images all 
over your wall or your mirror,

or trying to use them discreetly inside your 
closet or something - I've seen people do that -

you could just put them in THIS GUY and  

throw them in a hiding spot when 
other people visit your apartment.

No one's ever gonna see it, and you don't 
have to deal with people judging your goals.

Along with the fact that it's 
discreet, it is also highly portable.

Easy to throw in a bag, take with you 
on a trip - wherever you're going,

you never have to spend a day NOT thinking 
about what you're trying to do with your life.

In addition, if we treat this as a "flexible  

living organism," it is adaptable 
to any point in your life.

Let's say these are my core values and 
I will forever have them in my deck.

The next section might be something 
that I'm working on right now,  

and in the future, I won't need these -

I can replace them with the 
NEXT thing that I'm working on.

In my experience, the goals that 
I have are forever evolving,  

and yet my core values that I do find 
it helpful to review on a daily basis

are pretty much staying 
the same from year to year.

So, in this way, I don't 
have to recreate everything.  

I can just evolve it to fit my current situation.

I don't know about you, but 
this actually reminds me  

so much of doing multiplication 
flash cards when I was a kid,

and I hated them - but they worked. 
And they worked because of repetition.

If I have a big vision board in front of me,  

and all of the images and inspirational quotes 
and everything are all laid out in one big board,

it's hard to create any kind of 
hierarchy while I'm looking at it.

I don't know where to focus. I 
don't know what to focus on first.

This centers your focus. You 
read this card and you move on.

And as you do these day by day, it 
kind of gets burned into your brain.

I'm sure you're all wondering 
what is on these cards - uh -

so I'm gonna flip through them.

I might not share all of them, 
because some of this is private,

which is why I don't have a giant vision board 
up in my apartment - I prefer this method.

But I'll show you what I got.

The first one says, "you're reading this 
right now, which shows that you care."

Because sometimes I think to myself: "well,  

you're not working towards your 
goals as quickly as you should be,

and therefore, obviously, you don't care enough."

If you're reading this right now, 
it is proof that you DO care.

I think that's a good way to start it off,

and then I do go into next my "mission," 
which I've said before on a past video;

but my mission is to "provide an 
alternative to self-destruction,"

partially, just because that's what I need - 
but I think other people could use that as well.

And I get into it by saying "be 
yourself and share your style,

have fun in a HEALTHY pursuit of excellence."

I do want to pursue excellence, but 
I have "healthy" underlined here,  

because that is the most important aspect of this.

I have a list next of things I've 
accomplished before, which I will not read,

because it will sound like i'm bragging...

But at the bottom of it, I have a 
line that says, "you can do it again,"

and basically what I'm trying to 
do here is to remind myself that

there are things that I've accomplished that I 
didn't think that I was going to accomplish, and

I was able to do it - so while I'm looking 
forward at what I'm trying to accomplish next,

whenever it feels like I'm never 
going to be able to accomplish that,

I can look at this and say, "well, you thought 
the same thing about these, and you've done it,

so you could do it again!"

If you breathed your last breath 
today, would you be okay with that?

Currently? No.

Currently, I'm not where I 
want to be, not even close.

So the answer is no - but it's good 
to think about that on the daily.

Then I get into beliefs.

I like to review my beliefs to make 
sure that I'm prioritizing the things  

that I know to be important.

Belief number one is "my ideal will 
emerge through daily practice."

Might take longer than I want it to, but it will  

if I stick to a practice 
daily, my ideal will emerge.

As a supplement to that, I have a card that 
just says "patience, persistence, tenacity," and

I am a pretty patient person -

(pretty patient person)

- but I'm not very patient with myself.

So that's always something I need to focus on.

Persistence and tenacity I don't have as much 
of a problem with as I do patience, usually.

Belief number two is "what would 
this look like if it was easy?"

This is actually an idea adopted from Tim Ferriss.

Oftentimes, I find that the thing that's 
getting in the way of me doing something,  

getting something done, being productive, is me.

If I ask myself this question - "what would 
this look like if it was easy?" - I can then  

go into that task pretending like it's easy,

and usually it is.

It really doesn't need to be that 
hard - just give in, stop resisting.

Belief number three is "I do feel 
wealthy, fortunate, and grateful,  

but that doesn't mean that I 
feel fulfilled or challenged."

And that's okay, and I've had to remind myself 
of that a lot, especially over the past year -

I am extremely grateful for where I am - 
I'm extremely fortunate, I feel wealthy,  

but at the same time,

I have this need to progress.

This want for different things 
- not necessarily MORE but  

an exchange of some things that I have now -

some lifestyle, some habits, etc -

and I would like to change that, but that doesn't 
necessarily mean that what I have now is bad.

Spend your time, attention, 
and money on future pleasures.

This isn't always true - often times, 
when I'm by myself, this is true.

When I'm with other people, I like to be more 
present and not worrying about the future as much,

but especially when it comes to something 
like money, spending it on future pleasures -

such as retiring - is something 
that's good to think about,

even on a daily basis.

Belief number four is "you must think about 
your actions in terms of reward potential."

Drink water and stretch your hips!

These are two things that 
I know I need to do more.

And I know that if i can 
do this three times a day,

if I drink water and stretch 
my hips three times a day,

I feel so much better!

And yet, there's a part of me that resists 
both of these things, and it's stupid.

It's again "what would this look like if it was 
easy?" but why am I resisting things that I know

are going to make me feel better?

So this is just a reminder to drink 
water and stretch your hips, LEFIE!

Belief number five is "You 
already are disenchanted. You  

are making progress, and you will 
get there as rapidly as you can."

Again, this goes back to feeling like, "well,

if you're not doing it fast enough, 
obviously you don't want it enough..."

Um - but I do! And speed of achievement 
is not guaranteeing the achievement.

I AM making progress. I will get 
there as rapidly as i can, but I -

again, I'm not going to let my health 
suffer (for example) in order to get there.

I do have some affirmations, which 
I have titled as "THE TRUTH."

I'm not going to show you 
this one, but basically I've  

written down things that I 
know to be true about myself -

so one of those, for example, 
is that I'm open-minded.

That's true - I am open-minded,  

and it's a good thing to remind yourself 
of the qualities that you like in yourself,

not to focus on these solely, but to remind 
yourself that when you are feeling down  

when you don't quite think 
you like yourself very much,

read some things that you DO like about yourself, 
that you DO feel truly deep down are the truth,

and it can help you get back on the right path.

This next bunch are some photos - 
some reasons why i want what i want.

A lot of them are just titled 
"WHY" to remind myself of  

why I'm going to the effort 
to adapt, to adopt new habits,

to change in general -

why is it worth it? And what I'm aspiring to. What 
i'm trying to do with my life over the next year.

That's all of these... I'm 
skipping those, not sharing those.

I'm not sharing this one either...

Uh, this one is about specifically 
career stuff and making things.

This is a list of things that I'm interested 
in making at some point in the next year so.

Again, this is a little bit more short-term;

it's not so far-reaching, 
you know, lifetime values.

It's more things that I want to do that are 
currently on the back burner but can inspire me to

kind of get the stuff that I 
have on the plate right now done,

so that I can move on and 
start working on THESE things.

These next three slides are me writing 
down things about my ideal self,

so if I think of who I want to be in 10 years:

"Who is she? What does she do?" is the first card.

"What does she wear?" is the second card.

(I've been thinking about clothes a lot lately.)

And then "What would she own?" which, honestly,

there's not that much on 
there... surprise, surprise...

The cool thing about this is when I 
was thinking about what would she do,

a lot of the things that she would do are things 
that I do already, but it's the way that she would

react to those things that's different.

So, for example, "gets enough 
sleep, really treasures it."

So right now, I do get enough sleep,  

but the "treasuring it" part is 
something that I want to adapt.

I want to be grateful and conscious of 
the fact that I'm getting enough sleep -

really LOVE when I wake up and feel well rested.

Oh, here's another one! "Treat skin 
care like it's a sacred ritual."

So I already have pretty good skin care, 
but treating it like it's a "sacred ritual"  

gives it more meaning in terms of self-care.

So while I'm doing it, rather than 
thinking, "this is something I have  

to do," I could do the SAME THING and 
just change the way I think about it,

and say, "this is me taking care of myself."

That's what my ideal self would do.

So these are things that I'm working on 
changing through repetition. It's gonna happen.

"What would she wear?" It's -

It's very summer inspired, because 
I'm sick of wearing hoodies.

And "What would she own?" Uh -

there's a couple things on here 
like owning a house - I do not  

own a house - I would like to have 
a pool table in that said house.

I would like more coffee paraphernalia, 
such as a Moka Pot and such as a Chemex,

but I have no reason to buy a Moka Pot or a Chemex 
- I could, but I have no reason to do that now.

I think that once I'm living 
with someone else, that would  

actually be a reason to have something that 
creates more than one cup of coffee at a time.

Right now, I'm perfectly happy with my V60.

And then I do have a picture of my dream 
house, which I'm not going to get into,

but it is very inspiring to me.

I love the idea of owning a house someday,  

and I have very particular tastes 
- specifically mid-century modern.

I don't think that's going to surprise 
anyone because of my Nelson clock.

The last cards are all more daily stuff, so  

I have a card that has daily things on 
it that I want to make sure that I do.

So, for example, I want to go for a walk and 
listen to an audiobook every day - and this is  

just to remind me that that's something 
that I value and I think is important,

so when it comes to that time of day - 
I read these note cards in the morning,  

and I usually walk around noontime -

when it comes to that time of day, I can remember,

"Oh yeah, my notecard says that I should 
go for a walk, so I'm not gonna skip it."

I have a card that says 
"Free time? Free activities!"

and it's to remind myself that there are plenty of  

things to do that do not require any 
money and that make me very happy.

And then these last four cards 
are just kind of the next steps  

in my process for where I want to go with 
a couple of projects that i'm working on.

And so these cards, I would assume, would be 
switched out probably first, out of all of these.

Let me know if you use this method - I've 
only been using it for about a month now  

but i liked it so far -

and I'd be interested to hear if 
you have a different method as well!

I'm always up for experimenting 
and trying new things.

That's all I've got for today - so

'til next time!
